# WIP: Maybe will be a bootstrap someday
For now just storing these files for later cleanup or use.  Who knows.

Include things like 
- [Brew dump for MacOS](https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f)
  `brew bundle dump`
- dotfiles setup script


Any files with TOKENS need to be encrypted with [AGE]()
